Experimenting with parsing english headlines from a silly dictionary of words. Goofy laffs at media hysterics. I respect everyone on all sides much to the dismay of red team/blue team cheerleaders so no flame no anger please please 🙏

As the dictionary expands, this is losing comprehensibility. 

## To Do


-Rethink formatting and specific categories of words / structure
-Expand Dictionary
-Specify good intro Adverbs, specify more clause structures
-Build out more sentence structures
